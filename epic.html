									<p>The main area you should focus on strengthenin your hero is leveling them up to the MAX level, Heroes can gain upgrade on their base stats as they level up throughout the game.  Gain additional bonus stat for your hero by awakening your hero. This awakening is available every (Lv. 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, & 60) of the hero level, it also provides additional Hero skill enhancement for every 3rd awakening of the hero.  Strengthening your Hero skills is also one of the areas that you must consider, enhancing skills gives you additional damage, effect chance, and less cooldown to make your hero more effective in the battle.  Hero Equipment is where every player will have to compete for each of themselves. equipping the best gears for your hero can give you advantage against other players. You are going to grind for farming your best gear to compete with others.</p>
									<p>Memory Imprint is an area that's available when you have duplicates of the same hero that you are strengthening, Memory Imprint Release gives a bonus stats that can benefit the team or Imprint Concentration that can benefit the hero with Memory Imprint.  There are 3★Heroes that can undergo Specialty Change for them to become stronger, enabling them to compete against higher rate heroes.  Aside from doing Daily Tasks, doing tasks in Battle Mode can help raise your party's level. There are many other tasks you can do while leveling up your hero, like farming for resources and other similar activities.  Go from the Main Menu >> Hero then select your hero of choice. You can use the Enhance function then choose a Penguin to use as fodder for your heroes to level-up.</p>

									<p>The interface of the Battle system will look like the picture above, every battle that you will encounter this will be the default setup. The only differences that it will have is the monsters and heroes that you are using, you can also take note of the background where it changes on every content.</p>
									<p>The Turn Bar determines on which character will go first, it will start from the TOP to BOTTOM where the characters that are on bottom will be the first to take turn.  Skills are composed of your heroes three different skills, starting from the left to right: Basic Skill, Secondary Skill, Ultimate Skill. Choose wisely on how to use your heroes skills to have an advantage against the enemies and clear the game.  On the other side of your team is the enemy team, after choosing the skill that you want to use you can tap on which enemy that you are going to target. AoE attacks are different which will target all your enemies.
							There are certain skills that are used on your team (Eg. Heal, Buff, Resurrection) so the mechanisms for this skill are the same as attacking the enemy. You just have to tap the desired on which skill that you want to use.  The Soulburn Bar fills up with souls every time that you use a skill. You can use this bar to summon your Guardian or use the Soulburn Effect of your hero skills.</p>
