																<h3>Gameplay</h3>
															</header>
														<p>
															The core gameplay is that of a tower defense game, with a number of characters ("operators") as towers. Melee operators can be placed on ground tiles and ranged operators on elevated tiles. Melee operators physically block enemies from advancing, and ranged operators deal ranged damage, heal or otherwise support melee operators. Players must place operators on the correct tiles to prevent the enemy from infiltrating the player's base. Because there is often a limited number of viable solutions, especially at high difficulties, Arknights has also been described as a puzzle game. The gameplay does not require quick reaction times (the game is pauseable, and time slows down while commands are issued), but rather on-the-spot tactical analysis and foresight.
As the player progresses through the game, they unlock more stages, operators and resources, and are also introduced to new types of enemies and gameplay mechanics. Levels that have been cleared with a three-star rating can be auto-completed without player input, as the game records the player's actions and replicates them.

																	<h3>Story</h3>
																</header>
																<p>The game is set in the dystopian, post-apocalyptic future setting of the planet Terra, where people exhibit kemonomimi features – characteristics of animals or mythological races, also presents a type of magic known as "Arts". Natural disasters leave behind a valuable mineral, originium which infects people with a progressive disease, oripathy. Due to the disease's 100% mortality rate, and its high infectivity at the time of death, hostility towards the infected became widespread, leading to their mass quarantine and expulsion by governments worldwide, and sparking tensions between the infected and non-infected.</p>

																	<h3>Incentives</h3>
																</header>
																<p>The game features a weekly farming operation called Annihilation that allows one to farm up to 1200 Orundum icon.png a week, and clearing a few of the harder operations allow increasing that cap to 1800 Orundum icon.png.
																	Daily and weekly missions award up to 1200 Orundum icon.png per week if fully completed.
																	Every perfect stage clear awards 1 Originite Prime icon.png, which can be traded for 180 Orundum icon.png. Challenge Modes for stages that have them award 1 Originite Prime icon.png as well.
																	Character Outfits are purchased for either 15 Originite Prime icon.png or 18 Originite Prime icon.png meaning it is entirely possible to acquire skins without spending real money.</p>

																	<h3>Story</h3>
																</header>
																<p>The game features a system of Recruitment, or free gacha, of which a limited portion of the wider gacha pool is available entirely for free. However, the rates are much less generous, and it is significantly harder to get above 3★. Still, one can acquire most low rarity duplicates, and hope for the elusive Top Operator tag guaranteeing a 6★.
																	The main use of the Recruitment system for old-time players who more than likely have every non-rare unit in the pool to maximum Potential, is to farm a large amount of Commendation Certificate.png Commendation Certificate, and, hopefully, Distinction Certificate.png Distinction Certificate.</p>

															<h2>Character Roles</h2>
														</header>
														<p>Operators have many functionalities, ranging from directly fighting the enemy either with melee or long-ranged weaponry, using Originium Arts to attack the enemy with destructive magic, healing other Operators, or providing some form of offensive or defensive support.

															There are two types of Operators: melee and ranged. Melee Operators are deployed on lower ground, or "melee tiles," while ranged Operators are deployed on higher ground, or "ranged tiles."
															
															Most Operators have at least one and at most three skills to use, up to two base skills, and various talents.</p>
